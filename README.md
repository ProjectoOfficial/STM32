## Project Descriptions

### [Interrupts and Timers](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/Interrupts%20%26%20Timers)
In this project, you will explore the world of interrupts and timers on STM32 microcontrollers. Learn how to handle time-sensitive tasks, and discover practical applications.

### [MFRC522 Porting](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/STM32F103_MFRC522)
Ported an Arduino library to STM32 for the MFRC522 RFID module. Explore RFID technology and master the use of SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) for communication.

### [I2C Communication with BMP280](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/STM32_I2C)
Unlock the secrets of I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication with the BMP280 temperature and pressure sensor. Detailed instructions on interfacing STM32 with BMP280.

### [PWM Generation](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/STM32_PWM)
Delve into the realm of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Understand how PWM signals are generated on STM32 microcontrollers and their applications in control systems.
