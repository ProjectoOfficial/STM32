## Project Descriptions

### [Interrupts and Timers](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/Interrupts%20%26%20Timers)
In this project, you will explore the world of interrupts and timers on STM32 microcontrollers. Learn how to handle time-sensitive tasks, and discover practical applications.

### [MFRC522 Porting](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/STM32F103_MFRC522)
Ported an Arduino library to STM32 for the MFRC522 RFID module. Explore RFID technology and master the use of SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) for communication.

### [I2C Communication with BMP280](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/STM32_I2C)
Unlock the secrets of I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication with the BMP280 temperature and pressure sensor. Detailed instructions on interfacing STM32 with BMP280.

### [PWM Generation](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/STM32_PWM)
Delve into the realm of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Understand how PWM signals are generated on STM32 microcontrollers and their applications in control systems.

### [MCP2515 CAN BUS](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/STM32_MCP2515)
Discover our library to use the MCP2515 board on STM32 microcontrollers without CAN Peripherals. This way you can communicate on CAN BUS through any kind of STM32 micro.


### [MCP2551 CAN BUS](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/MCP2551_L432KC)
If your STM32 microcontroller has CAN Peripherals, why not using them? This allows to you to save space on your custom design PCBs, and configure the CAN protocol the way you want. Make sure that your STM32 micro directly supports CAN BUS communication.

### [SD Card SPI](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/STM32/tree/main/SDCard)
Set up an SD Card through SPI to create your own datalogger for your project.
