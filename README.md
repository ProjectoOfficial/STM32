## Project Descriptions

### [Interrupts and Timers](link_to_interrupts_timers_project)
In this project, you will explore the world of interrupts and timers on STM32 microcontrollers. Learn how to handle time-sensitive tasks, and discover practical applications.

### [MFRC522 Porting](link_to_mfrc522_project)
Ported an Arduino library to STM32 for the MFRC522 RFID module. Explore RFID technology and master the use of SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) for communication.

### [I2C Communication with BMP280](link_to_i2c_project)
Unlock the secrets of I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication with the BMP280 temperature and pressure sensor. Detailed instructions on interfacing STM32 with BMP280.

### [PWM Generation](link_to_pwm_project)
Delve into the realm of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Understand how PWM signals are generated on STM32 microcontrollers and their applications in control systems.
